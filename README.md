## Hi there 👋

My name is [Elora](https://wainwrightelora2.wixsite.com/wainwrightgamedesign). (nickname Leo) and I am an aspiring Game Designer, who graduated Falmouth University!

I am currently learning Unreal both interface and visual coding, along with my continued studies of Game Design.

I am learnt in Unity, Fork, and agile practices. 
My favourite tools are Milanote, Trello, Miro, and Obsidian.

I am currently making a multitude of short term projects to develop my skills as Game Designer and learn various engines/programs.
